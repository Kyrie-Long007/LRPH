# LRPH instances

If you consider using these instances, please cite the paper:
"Bernal-Moyano, J. A., Escobar, J. W., Marín-Moreno, C., Linfati, R., & Gatica, G. (2017). A comparison of trajectory granular based algorithms for the location-routing problem with heterogeneous fleet (LRPH). Dyna, 84(200)."

## Brief

The first three sets of instances are adapted from benchmarking instances for
the CLRP proposed by [1], [2] and [3] for the CLRP respectively. In particular,
for these sets of instances, the characteristics of the vehicles 
(fixed cost and capacities) have been modified in order to consider heterogeneous
fleet for a location-routing problem. The first data subset adapted from [1]
contains 36 instances with uncapacitated depots. The number of customers is
n = 100, 150 and 200. The number of potential depots is either 10 or 20.
The second data subset was adapted from [2], and considers 30 instances with
capacity constraints on routes and depots. The number of customers is 
n = 20, 50, 100 and 200. The number of potential depots is either 5 or 10.
Finally, the third data subset was adapted from [3], and considers 13 modified
instances obtained from classical CVRP instances by adding new depots with
capacities and fixed costs. The number of customers ranges from 21 to 150,
and the number of potential depots from 5 to 10. Finally, the fourth set is
adapted from [4]. Originally, the instances from [4] are proposed for the HFVRP.
In the HFVRP, all the depots are considered as opened to determine the routes
to be performed. On the other hand, for the LRPH all the depots are considered
as “potential”. Therefore, it is mandatory to select the depots to be opened
and the customers to be assigned to each open depot.
